follow these instructions & in real time narrate the images being show to you
Yeah, so, in the beginning you want a really strong hook, either visual or something that gets some question. and you want it to somehow prompt controversy, because if people are talking in the comments, that adds to watch time. And if people are split down the middle, people are either agreeing or disagreeing, that's really good. And then it should quickly show, people should quickly get what they're there for. And people should want to re-watch the video, because either it's like satisfying, or there's like, at least, you have to know what's in your niche, and like what's going viral in your niche, and what people are interested in, at least for gaming. If there's like some quick gimmick or some trick that they can implement into their own game, that they can want to share with their friends and re-watch it so that they can implement it. that also adds like the satisfying factor, so people, it makes it easier to re-watch. You want something that they can use and that way they share with their friends. It builds that interest for them. I would say TikTok is not that momentum-based. You can have one video get a million views and the next one get a thousand views. It doesn't carry it over as much. Unless you really build a brand and you upload it for like a year straight, every day, then people would stick around regardless of what you're uploading. But generally, you kind of want to go for virality on TikTok.

So visual can just be like subtitles or like some big full-screen text saying something, Got it. 
 
 The main thing is you do really want to provide value and you want to provide value first.
